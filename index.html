      <h2>Work History</h2>
      <p>
          As a teenager I started with farm work; cattle, horses, wheat, and maintance. After high school I started working at a local Chevrolet/Nissan dealership as a heavy line auto tech until I found my calling in the Army. 6 years and one tour of Afghanistan later I left the army to join the oil and natural gas industy where I have been for the last 12 years. Getting into the IT is something I have always wanted but never seen a clear path into until now.
